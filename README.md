# AI CLI Agent

AI CLI Agent is a powerful command-line assistant leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to simplify your terminal workflow. It can answer questions in a chat-like manner and autonomously generate, propose for execution, and analyze system commands.

Forget about googling PowerShell or bash syntaxâ€”just describe your task in natural language, and the agent will handle it for you!

## Features

- **Dual-Mode Operation:**
  - **Agent Mode:** Describe a task (e.g., "create a folder named 'test' and navigate into it"), and the agent will generate and execute the required command.
  - **Chat Mode:** Prefix your query with `!` to get a direct answer from the AI without executing any commands.

- **Safe Execution:** The agent asks for your confirmation before running any generated commands.

- **Automatic Retries:** If a command fails, the agent attempts to fix it and suggests a new version. The number of retries is configurable.

- **Cross-Platform:** Supports PowerShell on Windows and bash on Linux/macOS.

- **Result Analysis:** After executing a command successfully, the AI summarizes what was done; if an error occurs, it analyzes the cause.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Includes colored output, loading spinners, and well-formatted blocks for easy reading.

- **Session Management:** Maintains conversation history within a session, which can be cleared with the `/clear` command.
